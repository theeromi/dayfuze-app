- **Cross-platform notifications**

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Web App** (for web access): Click "Deploy" in your current Replit
2. **Create Expo Project** (for mobile apps): Follow setup instructions above
3. **Test on Device**: Use Expo Go to test all features
4. **Build & Submit**: Use EAS to build and submit to app stores

Your users will have:
- üåê **Web app** (PWA installable) 
- üì± **Native mobile apps** (iOS & Android app stores)
- üîÑ **Real-time sync** between all platforms
