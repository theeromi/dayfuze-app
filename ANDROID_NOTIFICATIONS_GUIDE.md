## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Service Worker:
```javascript
// Native push notifications
self.addEventListener('push', event => {
  // Android APK-style notification with actions
  const options = {
    requireInteraction: true,  // Persistent notification
    vibrate: [200, 100, 200], // Custom vibration
    actions: [
      { action: 'complete', title: '✓ Complete' },
      { action: 'snooze', title: '⏰ Snooze 10min' },
      { action: 'view', title: '👁 View' }
    ]
  };
});
```

### Notification Scheduling:
