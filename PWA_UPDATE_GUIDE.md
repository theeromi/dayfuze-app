# PWA Update Mechanism - How It Works

## How PWA Updates Work for Installed Users

When a user installs your DayFuse web app to their device (iOS/Android), they get a native-like app experience. Here's how updates work:

### 1. **Automatic Update Detection**
- The service worker checks for updates every 30 minutes
- When you deploy new code, the browser detects the updated service worker
- A new version is downloaded in the background

### 2. **User Experience**
- Users see an "Update Available" prompt in the top-right corner
- They can choose to "Update Now" or "Later"
- If they choose "Later", they'll be reminded again in 1 hour

### 3. **Update Process**
- When user clicks "Update Now", the app refreshes
- The new service worker activates immediately (`skipWaiting()`)
- Old caches are cleared automatically
- User gets the latest version instantly

### 4. **Cache Strategy**
- **Cache Name**: Updates from `dayfuse-v1` to `dayfuse-v2` (increment for each update)
- **Strategy**: Network-first, then cache fallback
- **Assets Cached**: Main app files, icons, manifest
- **Cache Cleanup**: Old caches are automatically deleted

## For You as the Developer

### When You Deploy Updates:

1. **Increment Cache Version**
   ```javascript
   // In client/public/sw.js
   const CACHE_NAME = 'dayfuse-v3'; // Increment this number
   ```

2. **Users Will Automatically Get:**
   - Background download of new version
   - Update prompt notification
   - Seamless update experience

### What Gets Updated:
- All JavaScript/CSS changes
- New features and bug fixes
- UI/UX improvements
- API endpoint changes

### What Persists:
- User authentication (Firebase handles this)
- User's tasks and data (stored in Firebase)
- App preferences and settings
