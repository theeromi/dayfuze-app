# Overview

**DayFuse** has been completely transformed from a web-based PWA to a **cross-platform mobile app** built with Expo and React Native. This productivity-focused task management application now provides native mobile experiences across iOS and Android platforms, while maintaining the core functionality of task creation, organization, and tracking with Firebase integration.

The application follows a mobile-first React Native architecture using Expo SDK, Firebase for authentication and real-time data synchronization, and modern React Native patterns for state management and navigation.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript and follows a component-based architecture:

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for consistent theming
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library for accessible, customizable components
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication and task management state
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query for server state management and caching
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The frontend follows a mobile-first responsive design with PWA capabilities including service worker implementation for offline functionality.

## Backend Architecture

The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript in a modular structure:

- **Framework**: Express.js with middleware for JSON parsing and request logging
- **Development**: Hot reloading with Vite integration in development mode
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware
- **Routing**: Modular route registration system with API prefix structure
- **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage interface allowing for multiple implementations (currently in-memory, designed for database integration)

## Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database**: PostgreSQL configured through Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations in `/migrations` directory
- **Database Client**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Zod integration for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Definition**: Centralized schema in `/shared/schema.ts` with user management tables

**Client-side Storage**: Firebase integration for real-time data and authentication
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for user management
- **Real-time Database**: Firestore for task data with real-time synchronization
